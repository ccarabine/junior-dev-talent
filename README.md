### Definitions
-	models.ManytoManyField -A ManyToMany field - is used when a model needs to reference multiple instances of another model. E.g. A user can vote on many posts and votes can have many posts. 

- Foreign key - Foreign Key is a ORM(Object-Relational Mapper) field-to-column mapping for creating and working with relationships between tables in relational databases.
e.g.on the Post model topic is the Foreign Key to the Topic model

-	On_delete cascade – delete the rows from the child table automatically, when the rows from the parent table are deleted.  E.g. if you delete a post, all of the comments and votes are related to the post will be deleted

-	On_delete=models. PROTECT – do not delete this field in the related model

-	Default – gives a default value

-	Blank = True – allows the field to be blank, False means they cannot be blank

-	Null – store empty values as NULL in the database. Default is False

-	Max_length – max length of characters a user can enter

-	Unique – the value needs to be unique in the database

-	SlugField - A slug field is used to store and generate valid URLs for your dynamically created web pages. It will add”-“ where there are spaces in the url

-	Related name - This is used when one record of a model A is related to exactly one record of another model B.  e.g. post field in the vote model is the same as the Foreignkey so we give it a related name “vote_post”


-	Auto_now_add=True – gives the field the date when it was created

-	Class meta - l Meta is basically the inner class of your model class. Model Meta is basically used to change the behavior of your model fields like changing order options,verbose_name and lot of other options

-	Verbose name -  is a human-readable name for the field. If the verbose name isn't given, Django will automatically create it using the field's attribute name, converting underscores to spaces

-	Ordering = ascending or descending

-	__str__(self)    return str(self.title) converts the object into a string for the admin page

-	get_absolute_url(self return f”/topic/{self.post.id}- converts the object in to a url string  “topic/post/1” for example

## v. Surface <a name="surface"></a>

### **Typography**

The following font Roboto have been selected to ensure the text is easy to read, add value to the text, and invoke user to perceive a positive emotion from the text. The fonts chosen are generic and therefore should appeal to any demographic/user. It is rated as Google's best font.

![screenshot of google fonts](readme/images/surface/roboto_font.png)

### **Imagery**
Likewise for the hero images on the home page I selected imagery aligned to software engineering, plus my colour palette to make the home page visually pleasing and eye catching whilst ensuring the styling throughout the platform is consistent
Please refer to further details in credits section for specific images used within the project

Python Libraries
I have used these third-party libraries for this project for the following reasons:

- request
    - Django uses request and response objects to pass state through the system.
    - When a page is requested, Django creates an HttpRequest object that contains metadata about the request. Then Django loads the appropriate view, passing the HttpRequest as the first argument to the view function. Each view is responsible for returning an HttpResponse object.

- django 
    - from django.contrib import messages - used for flash messages
    - from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required - used to restrict access to methods/functions(backend) in the front end
    - from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin - used for class based views -flash messages
    - from django.core.paginator import Paginator - used for pagination functionality
    - from django.core.mail import send_mail - used for sending emails
    - from django.db.models import F, Q Q is used to filter an object
        - Using F() objects can directly reference the values ​​of model fields and perform database operations instead of importing them into python 's memory and then performing operations, which can efficiently complete batch data operations. e.g. Use F() expression combined with update() method to modify the price of books    
            - e.g. books = Book.objects.update(price=F('price')+50)
        - The Q() expression can realize logical operations such as OR , & , NOT.
        - e.g. The query book id number is 1 Or title is Dream of the Red ChamberBook information, books = Book.objects.filter(Q(id=1) | Q(name='Dream of the Red ChamberBook information'))
    - from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect
        - HttpResponse (source code) provides an inbound HTTP request to a Django web application with a text response. This class is most frequently used as a return object from a Django view.
        - HttpResponseRedirect is a subclass of HttpResponse (source code) in the Django web framework that returns the HTTP 302 status code, indicating the URL resource was found but temporarily moved to a different URL. This class is most frequently used as a return object from a Django view.
    - from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404, reverse, redirect
        - The purpose of render() is to return an HttpResponse whose content is filled with the result of calling render_to_string() with the passed arguments
        - Get_object_or_404: is a method that returns a 404 error if the object does not exist
        - the reverse function allows to retrieve url details from url's.py file through the name value provided there
        - Redirect is used to redirect the user to another URL by returning an instance of HttpResponseRedirect or HttpResponsePermanentRedirect from your view
    - from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify -A slug is a short label for something, containing only letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens. They're generally used in URLs.
    - from django.urls import reverse_lazy -providing a reversed URL as the url attribute of a generic class-based view
    - from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator -The method_decorator decorator transforms a function decorator into a method decorator so that it can be used on an instance method. used for login required

-  from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView, UpdateView
-  from django.views.generic import DeleteView, CreateView

Class-based views provide an alternative way to implement views as Python objects instead of functions.
-  I used class based views for the following reasons
    - Code reusability - a view class can be inherited by another view class and modified for a different use case.
    - DRY -  help to reduce code duplication
    - Code extendability - CBV can be extended to include more functionalities using Mixins
    - Code structuring - In CBVs A class based view helps you respond to different http request with different class instance methods instead of conditional branching statements inside a single function based view.
    - Built-in generic class-based views
